# Motivation
There are a many great videos on YouTube that approximate what sorting algorithms would sound like. There is also a very comprehensive standalone desktop app that does the same. This webapp is an attempt to translate that to something that can be run in the browser.

# Technologies
* The entire front-end is written in React
* The sorting algorithms are in Typescript
* The sound is generated using the Tone.js library

# Installation
If you'd like to run this locally, feel free to clone the repo, run `npm run build` and then `npm start`.
